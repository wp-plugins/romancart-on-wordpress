rcw_dropdownbox('BETA Release Only','This version is a BETA. Maybe functions and scripts will be removed before release for various reasons. This release is to get feedback and 
				response on the direction of the plugin before we make another release. The software or services provided may not reflect what is said in content within the plugin. We hope to
				get a lot of feedback before dedicating a lot of time into making premium services. If the plugin is popular we will release all the content 
				stated within this free edition and eventually provide premium material. That will include a more advanced plugin plus premium tutorials that can be
				downloaded on purchase.','','closed');

rcw_dropdownbox('Unofficial RomanCart Software','This software has been created to support users of the RomanCart Shopping Cart service and help them get the most out of
				a Wordpress e-commerce site using RomancCart. The development team is not connected to RomanCart in any way and we will avoid duplication of any existing
				RomanCart services as best as we can. This software encourages the use of RomanCart 
				and has the goal of increasing the ability to use multiple RomanCart accounts on one site among many other advantages. Sales income from the premium edition is intended 
				to cover full time labour costs for support staff available by phone, email, blog, forum. We will also create may online tutorial videos and more. 
				Support for RomanCart operations connected to the use of this plugin with your blog must be sought at BrighterWebs.com. 
				No support should be expected from the RomanCart team as they have no knowledge of how the software operates. "RomanCart on Wordpress" is what the plugin
				does rather than a brand/product name also, the name is not reserve by WebTechGlobal.','','closed');
